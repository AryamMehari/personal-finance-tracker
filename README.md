# 💰 Personal Finance Tracker (Python + SQLite)

Hi! 👋 This is a simple little project I made while learning Python.  
It’s a command-line app that helps you track your spending and income. I built it to get more practice with things like working with databases and user input in Python.

### 🔧 What it can do:
- Add income or expense transactions
- View all transactions in a table format
- See a summary of your spending by category
- Saves your data in a local SQLite database file (`finance.db`)

### 🧠 What I learned building this:
- How to connect Python to a database (SQLite)
- Writing SQL queries inside Python
- Creating functions and menus in the terminal
- Formatting output using the `tabulate` library

### 🛠️ Tech used:
- Python 3
- SQLite (built into Python, no setup needed)
- `tabulate` for nice table formatting in the terminal

---

### ▶️ How to run it:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed  
2. Install `tabulate` by running:  
   ```bash
   pip install tabulate
